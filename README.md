# Jakarta EE9: DayTrader9 Sample

This sample contains the DayTrader 9 benchmark, which is an application built around the paradigm of an online stock trading system. The application allows users to login, view their portfolio, lookup stock quotes, and buy or sell stock shares. With the aid of a Web-based load driver such as Apache JMeter, the real-world workload provided by DayTrader can be used to measure and compare the performance of Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) application servers offered by a variety of vendors. In addition to the full workload, the application also contains a set of primitives used for functional and performance testing of various Java EE components and common design patterns.

DayTrader is an end-to-end benchmark and performance sample application. It provides a real world Java EE workload. DayTrader's new design spans Jakarta EE 9.

This sample can be installed onto Liberty runtime versions 21.0.0.3-beta and later. A prebuilt derby database is provided in resources/data

## Quickstart

- To run this sample, first [download](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample.daytrader9/archive/master.zip) or clone this repo - to clone:
```
git clone git@github.com:OpenLiberty/sample.daytrader9.git
```

- From inside the sample.daytrader9 directory, build and start the application in Open  Liberty with the following command:

```
mvn clean liberty:install-server package liberty:run
```

The server will listen on port 9080 by default.  You can change the port (for example, to port 9081) by adding `-DtestServerHttpPort=9081` to the end of the Maven command.

Once the server is started, you should be able to access the application at:
http://localhost:9080/daytrader

## Maven commands

- Start Open Liberty in the background.
```
mvn liberty:start
```

- Stop background Open Liberty
```
mvn liberty:stop
```

- Check Open Liberty status.
```
mvn liberty:status
```

- Package application 
```
mvn package
```

- Deploy application to Open Liberty
```
mvn liberty:deploy
```

### Open Liberty server commands

When Open Liberty is installed using Maven, files are in target/liberty/wlp-directory.

Binaries are in bin-directory and the main binary is server-command (server.bat for Windows). 

- Start server:
```
server start
```

- server top, status, run:
```
server stop|status|run
```

- Server version:
```
server version
```

- Package defaultServer as zip:

```
server package defaultServer --archive=DayTraderApp.zip --include=all
```
This packages the application and all Open Liberty files to zip-package that can be distributed where needed.

- Package application and server as runnable jar:
```
server package defaultServer --archive=DayTraderApp.jar --include=minify,runnable
```
